Hello and welcome to my personal tech blog! My name is Álvaro, and I’m excited to start sharing my journey, projects, and thoughts with you.

## Why This Blog?

The main purpose of this blog is to document and share my experiences as I explore different areas of technology and software engineering. Whether it’s a new framework, a side project, or just some thoughts on the industry, I want this space to be a resource for myself and anyone interested in similar topics.

## Introducing Project B.E.L.E.N

One of the first projects I’ll be documenting here is **B.E.L.E.N**: _Balanced Efficient Local Ephemeral Nodes_. This is an initiative to build my own Kubernetes cluster server from scratch. The goal is to create a balanced and efficient local environment for running ephemeral workloads, experimenting with distributed systems, and learning more about cloud-native technologies—right from my own hardware.

I’ll be sharing the design decisions, challenges, and lessons learned as I progress with B.E.L.E.N. If you’re interested in Kubernetes, home labs, or self-hosted infrastructure, I hope you’ll find these posts useful.

## What to Expect

While Project B.E.L.E.N will be a major focus at the start, this blog isn’t limited to just one project. I’ll also be posting about other topics that interest me in technology and software engineering—ranging from best practices and tools to personal reflections and industry trends.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy the journey with me!
